#Assignment 1
##Katherine Cummings

For this assignment I used the data source from the example, the "Wimp Weather Station".

The specific data pulled from the stream was the wind speed (mph) and wind direction categories on the stream.

I included the two basic graphs and a custom visualization of the wind speed data.

To complete this assignment, I used the paper.js and JQuery libraries.
